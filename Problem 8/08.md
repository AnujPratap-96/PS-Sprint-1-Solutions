# Factorial Calculator

This directory contains a C++ program that calculates the factorial of a given number using both recursive and iterative methods.

## Code Explanation

### Function to Calculate Factorial Using Recursion

```cpp
long long factorial(int n) {
    // Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1
    if(n == 0 || n == 1) return 1;
    
    // Recursive case: n * factorial of (n-1)
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

- **Logic**:
  - The function `factorial` takes an integer `n` as input.
  - It checks for the base case where if `n` is 0 or 1, it returns 1.
  - If `n` is greater than 1, it returns `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n - 1`, effectively reducing the problem size with each recursive call.

### Function to Calculate Factorial Using Iteration

```cpp
long long Factorial(int n) {
    long long fact = 1; // Initialize factorial result to 1
    // Loop from n down to 1
    for(int i = n; i >= 1; i--) {
        fact *= i; // Multiply current i to the factorial result
    }
    return fact; // Return the calculated factorial
}
```

- **Logic**:
  - The function `Factorial` initializes a variable `fact` to 1 to store the factorial result.
  - It uses a loop to iterate from `n` down to 1, multiplying each value to `fact`.
  - Finally, it returns the calculated factorial.

### Main Function

```cpp
int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter a Number to find factorial: "; // Prompt user for input
    cin >> n; // Read the input number

    // Using Iteration to calculate factorial
    cout << "Factorial of " << n << " is " << Factorial(n) << endl;

    // Using Recursion to calculate factorial
    cout << "Factorial of " << n << " is " << factorial(n) << endl;

    return 0; // End the program
}
```

- **Logic**:
  - The `main` function prompts the user to enter a number and reads the input.
  - It then calls both the iterative and recursive functions to calculate and display the factorial of the entered number.

## Summary

- The program provides two methods for calculating the factorial of a given number: recursion and iteration.
- Both methods are demonstrated in the output, allowing users to see the results for the same input.
