# GCD Calculator

This directory contains a C++ program that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers using three different approaches: Brute Force, Better Approach, and Euclidean Algorithm.

## Code Explanation

### Brute Force Method

```cpp
int BruteGCD(int a, int b) {
    int gcd = 1;
    for(int i = 1; i <= min(a, b); i++) {
        if(a % i == 0 && b % i == 0) {
            gcd = i;
        }
    }
    return gcd;
}
```

- **Logic**: 
  - The brute force method iterates through all numbers from `1` to the minimum of `a` and `b`.
  - If a number divides both `a` and `b`, it is considered as the current GCD.
  - Finally, the largest such number is returned.

### Better Approach

```cpp
int BetterGCD(int a, int b) {
    int gcd = 1;
    for(int i = min(a, b); i >= 1; i--) {
        if(a % i == 0 && b % i == 0) {
            gcd = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    return gcd;
}
```

- **Logic**:
  - This method starts checking from the minimum of `a` and `b` and moves downwards.
  - Once the largest common divisor is found, the loop is exited, making it slightly more efficient than brute force.

### Optimal Approach (Euclidean Algorithm)

```cpp
int OptimalGCD(int a, int b) {
    while(a > 0 && b > 0) {
        if(a > b) a = a % b;
        else b = b % a;
    }
    return (a != 0) ? a : b;
}
```

- **Logic**:
  - The Euclidean Algorithm is the most efficient method.
  - It works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder when divided by the smaller number until one of the numbers becomes 0.
  - The non-zero number at the end is the GCD.

### Main Function

```cpp
int main() {
    int a, b;
    cout << "Enter Numbers to Find GCD: ";
    cin >> a >> b;
    cout << "GCD Using Brute Force: " << BruteGCD(a, b) << endl;
    cout << "GCD Using Better Approach: " << BetterGCD(a, b) << endl;
    cout << "GCD Using Optimal Approach: " << OptimalGCD(a, b) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

- **Logic**:
  - The program prompts the user to input two numbers `a` and `b`.
  - It then calls the GCD functions with different methods and displays the results.

## Summary

- This program calculates the GCD of two numbers using three approaches:
  1. **Brute Force**: Checks all possible divisors.
  2. **Better Approach**: Starts checking divisors from the minimum value of `a` and `b`.
  3. **Optimal Approach (Euclidean Algorithm)**: Uses the efficient method of division and modulus.
