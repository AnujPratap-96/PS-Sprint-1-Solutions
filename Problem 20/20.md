This directory contains a C++ program that checks whether a given number is a **Perfect Number** using two different methods:

1. **Brute Force Method**: A straightforward approach that sums all divisors of the number.
2. **Optimal Method**: An efficient approach that only checks divisors up to the square root of the number.

## Code Explanation

### Brute Force Method

```cpp
bool PerfectNumberBrute(int n) {
    int sum = 0; 
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) { 
        if (n % i == 0) {
            sum += i; 
        }
    }
    return sum == n && n != 0; 
}
```

- **Logic**:
  - This method iterates through all integers from \(1\) to \(n-1\) and checks if each number is a divisor of \(n\).
  - If it is, the number is added to a cumulative sum.
  - The function returns `true` if the sum of divisors equals \(n\), indicating that \(n\) is a perfect number.

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

### Optimal Method

```cpp
bool PerfectNumberOptimal(int n) {
    int sum = 0; 
    for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            sum += i; 
            if ((n / i) != i && (n / i) != n) {
                sum += n / i; 
            }
        }
    }
    return sum == n && n != 0; 
}
```

- **Logic**:
  - This method only iterates from \(1\) to \(\sqrt{n}\).
  - For each divisor \(i\), it adds both \(i\) and the corresponding divisor \(n/i\) to the sum, provided \(n/i\) is different from \(i\) and not equal to \(n\).
  - It returns `true` if the sum of divisors equals \(n\).

- **Time Complexity**: O(âˆšn)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

### Main Function

```cpp
int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter a Number to Check: ";
    cin >> n; 

    if (PerfectNumberBrute(n))
        cout << n << " is a Perfect Number (Brute Force Method)";
    else
        cout << n << " is not a Perfect Number (Brute Force Method)";

    cout << "\n";

    if (PerfectNumberOptimal(n))
        cout << n << " is a Perfect Number (Optimal Method)";
    else
        cout << n << " is not a Perfect Number (Optimal Method)";

    return 0; 
}
```

- **Logic**:
  - The program prompts the user to input a number and checks if it is a perfect number using both the brute force and optimal methods.
  - Results are displayed accordingly.

## Summary

This program provides two methods to check if a number is a perfect number:

1. **Brute Force Method**: A straightforward but less efficient approach that checks all potential divisors.
2. **Optimal Method**: A more efficient approach that minimizes time complexity by reducing the number of checks to the square root of the number.

The optimal method is recommended for use in practical applications, especially when checking larger numbers.
