Hereâ€™s a `README.md` file that explains the Fibonacci sequence program:

```markdown
# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This directory contains a C++ program that generates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified limit.

## Code Explanation

### Fibonacci Function

```cpp
void Fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        cout << "No Number is in the Sequence"; 
        return; 
    }

    int a = 0, b = 1; 
    cout << a << " " << b << " "; 

    while (1) {
        int temp = a + b; 
        a = b;            
        b = temp;        

        if (b <= n) {
            cout << b << " "; 
        } else {
            break; 
        }
    }
}
```

- **Logic**: 
  - The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
  - The function checks if the limit \( n \) is 0 and prints a message if there are no numbers to display.
  - It initializes the first two numbers of the sequence (0 and 1) and prints them.
  - It then enters an infinite loop to calculate and print subsequent Fibonacci numbers until the next number exceeds the specified limit.

### Main Function

```cpp
int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the limit up to you want in the Fibonacci sequence: "; 
    cin >> n; 
    Fibonacci(n); 
    return 0; 
}
```

- **Logic**: 
  - The `main` function prompts the user to enter a limit for the Fibonacci sequence.
  - It reads the limit value from the user and calls the `Fibonacci` function to generate the sequence up to that limit.
  - The program ends after the Fibonacci sequence has been printed.

## Summary

- The program generates and displays the Fibonacci sequence up to the user-defined limit.
- If the input limit is 0, it notifies the user that no numbers are in the sequence.
