# Fibonacci Number Finder

This directory contains a C++ program that calculates the Fibonacci number at a specified position using two different methods:

1. **Recursive Method**: A straightforward approach that uses recursion to compute Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Iterative Method**: A more efficient approach that uses iteration to compute Fibonacci numbers.

## Code Explanation

### Recursive Method

```cpp
int FibonacciRecursive(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;  // Base case: F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
    }
    return FibonacciRecursive(n - 1) + FibonacciRecursive(n - 2); // Recursive calls
}
```

- **Logic**:
  - This method computes the Fibonacci number by calling itself for the previous two Fibonacci numbers.
  - Base cases are defined for \(F(0) = 0\) and \(F(1) = 1\).

- **Time Complexity**: O(2^n), which makes it inefficient for large values of \(n\).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to the recursion stack.

### Iterative Method

```cpp
int FibonacciIterative(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;  // Base case: F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
    }

    int a = 0, b = 1;  // Initial Fibonacci numbers
    int fib = 0;       // Variable to hold the Fibonacci number

    // Loop to calculate Fibonacci number
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        fib = a + b;  // F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
        a = b;        // Update F(n-2) to F(n-1)
        b = fib;      // Update F(n-1) to F(n)
    }
    return fib;  // Return the Fibonacci number at position n
}
```

- **Logic**:
  - This method calculates the Fibonacci number iteratively using a loop.
  - It maintains two variables to store the last two Fibonacci numbers and updates them in each iteration.

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), making it efficient for larger values of \(n\).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since it uses a constant amount of space.

### Main Function

```cpp
int main() {
    int n;  // Position to find Fibonacci number
    cout << "Enter the position of the Fibonacci number: ";
    cin >> n;

    // Using the recursive method (not recommended for large n)
    cout << "Fibonacci number at position " << n << " (Recursive): " << FibonacciRecursive(n) << endl;

    // Using the iterative method
    cout << "Fibonacci number at position " << n << " (Iterative): " << FibonacciIterative(n) << endl;

    return 0; // Indicate successful execution
}
```

- **Logic**:
  - The program prompts the user to input the desired position \(n\).
  - It calculates and displays the Fibonacci number at that position using both the recursive and iterative methods.

## Summary

This program provides two methods to calculate the Fibonacci number at a given position:
1. **Recursive Method**: A straightforward but inefficient approach, particularly for large \(n\).
2. **Iterative Method**: A more efficient approach suitable for practical applications, especially when dealing with larger values of \(n\).

For optimal performance, it is recommended to use the iterative method for calculating Fibonacci numbers.
