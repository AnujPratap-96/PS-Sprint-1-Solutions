# Sum of Even Numbers in a Range

This directory contains a C++ program that calculates the sum of even numbers within a specified range using two different methods:

1. **Brute Force Method**: A straightforward approach that iterates through each number in the range and checks if it is even.
2. **Optimal Method**: An efficient approach that calculates the sum of even numbers without explicitly iterating through each one.

## Code Explanation

### Brute Force Method

```cpp
int EvenSumInRangeBrute(int start, int end) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            sum += i; // Add even number to sum
        }
    }
    return sum; // Return total sum of even numbers
}
```

- **Logic**:
  - This method iterates through each number from `start` to `end` and checks if it is even.
  - If a number is even, it is added to the cumulative sum.

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of integers in the range.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space.

### Optimal Method

```cpp
int EvenSumInRangeOptimal(int start, int end) {
    if (start % 2 != 0) {
        start++; // Adjust start to the next even number
    }
    if (end % 2 != 0) {
        end--; // Adjust end to the previous even number
    }
    if (start > end) {
        return 0; // No even numbers in range
    }
    
    int n = (end - start) / 2 + 1; // Count of even numbers
    return n * (start + end) / 2; // Return sum using arithmetic series formula
}
```

- **Logic**:
  - This method adjusts `start` and `end` to the nearest even numbers.
  - It calculates the count of even numbers in the adjusted range and uses the arithmetic series formula to compute the sum.

- **Time Complexity**: O(1), as it performs a constant number of operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), using a constant amount of space.

### Main Function

```cpp
int main() {
    int start, end;
    cout << "Enter the starting and ending ranges: ";
    cin >> start >> end;

    // Call and display results for brute force method
    cout << "Sum of Even Numbers between Range " << start << " to " << end << " (Brute Force Method): " 
         << EvenSumInRangeBrute(start, end) << endl;

    // Call and display results for optimal method
    cout << "Sum of Even Numbers between Range " << start << " to " << end << " (Optimal Method): " 
         << EvenSumInRangeOptimal(start, end) << endl;

    return 0; // Indicate successful execution
}
```

- **Logic**:
  - The program prompts the user to input the starting and ending ranges.
  - It calculates and displays the sum of even numbers using both the brute force and optimal methods.

## Summary

This program provides two methods to calculate the sum of even numbers in a given range:
1. **Brute Force Method**: A straightforward but less efficient approach.
2. **Optimal Method**: A more efficient approach that minimizes time complexity.

The optimal method is recommended for practical applications, especially when dealing with larger ranges.
