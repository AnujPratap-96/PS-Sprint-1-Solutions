# Multiplication Table Generator

This directory contains a C++ program that generates and prints the multiplication table for a given integer from 1 to 10.

## Code Explanation

### Main Function

```cpp
int main() {
    int n; // Variable to store the number for which the multiplication table will be generated
    cout << "Enter a number to generate table: ";
    cin >> n; // Read the number from user input

    // Loop to generate and print the multiplication table
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        cout << n << " * " << i << " = " << n * i << endl; // Print each line of the multiplication table
    }

    return 0; // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
}
```

- **Logic**:
  - The program prompts the user to enter a number.
  - It reads the input number and then uses a loop to iterate from 1 to 10.
  - In each iteration, it calculates the product of the input number and the loop index, then prints the result in a formatted string.

- **Time Complexity**: O(1), as the loop always runs a fixed number of times (10).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space.

## Summary

This program is a straightforward implementation that allows users to generate the multiplication table for any integer from 1 to 10. The simplicity of the logic makes it efficient and easy to understand.
