Hereâ€™s a `README.md` file that explains the pyramid pattern program:

```markdown
# Pyramid Pattern Generator

This directory contains a C++ program that generates a pyramid pattern of stars based on user input for the height of the pyramid.

## Code Explanation

### Function to Print the Pyramid

```cpp
void Pyramid(int n) {
    // Loop through each level of the pyramid
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Print spaces to center align the pyramid
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            cout << " "; // Print space before the stars
        }
        // Print stars for the current level
        for (int j = 0; j < 2 * i + 1; j++) {
            cout << "*"; // Print stars in increasing order
        }
        cout << endl; // Move to the next line after each level
    }
}
```

- **Logic**: 
  - The function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the height of the pyramid.
  - The outer loop iterates through each level of the pyramid.
  - The first inner loop prints spaces to align the stars to the center.
  - The second inner loop prints stars, where the number of stars increases with each level.
  - After printing each level, a new line is printed to move to the next row.

### Main Function

```cpp
int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the Height of the Pyramid: "; // Prompt user for input
    cin >> n; // Read the height of the pyramid
    Pyramid(n); // Call the function to print the pyramid pattern
    return 0; // End the program
}
```

- **Logic**: 
  - The `main` function prompts the user to enter the height of the pyramid and reads the input.
  - It then calls the `Pyramid` function to generate and display the pyramid pattern based on the specified height.

## Summary

- The program generates a pyramid of stars based on the height specified by the user.
- The output visually represents a pyramid shape made of asterisks, centered appropriately.
