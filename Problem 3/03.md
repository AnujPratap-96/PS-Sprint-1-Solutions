# Leap Year Checker

This directory contains a C++ program that checks whether a given year is a leap year or not.

## Code Explanation

### Leap Year Function

```cpp
void LeapYear(int n) {
    if (n % 4 == 0 && n % 100 != 0 || n % 400 == 0) {
        cout << "The year " << n << " is a leap year.";
    } else {
        cout << "The year " << n << " is not a leap year.";
    }
}
```

- **Logic**: 
  - A year is a leap year if it satisfies the following conditions:
    - It is divisible by 4 **and** not divisible by 100 **or**
    - It is divisible by 400.
  - If the year meets these criteria, the function outputs that it is a leap year. Otherwise, it is not.
  
- **Key Conditions**:
  - **Divisible by 4**: The year must be divisible by 4.
  - **Not Divisible by 100**: If the year is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.

### Main Function

```cpp
int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter a year: ";
    cin >> n;
    LeapYear(n);
    return 0;
}
```

- **Logic**: 
  - The `main` function prompts the user to enter a year.
  - The entered year is passed to the `LeapYear` function, which checks if it is a leap year.
  - The result is printed on the console.

## Summary

- The program checks whether a given year is a leap year based on the defined conditions.
- The output tells the user whether the year is a leap year or not.
