# Armstrong Number Checker

This directory contains a C++ program that checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not.

## Code Explanation

### Armstrong Function

```cpp
void Armstrong(int n) {
    int sum = 0;           
    int temp = n;          

    while(n > 0) {
        int res = n % 10;         
        sum = sum + pow(res, 3); 
        n = n / 10;               
    }
    
    if(temp == sum) {
        cout << temp << " is an Armstrong number" << endl; 
    } else {
        cout << temp << " is not an Armstrong number" << endl; 
    }
}
```

- **Logic**: 
  - An Armstrong number (specifically for 3-digit numbers) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of three.
  - The function computes the sum of the cubes of each digit of the number. 
  - It compares the original number with the computed sum to determine if it is an Armstrong number.
  
- **Key Steps**:
  - The original number is stored in `temp` for comparison.
  - Each digit is extracted and cubed using the `pow` function.
  - The sum of these cubes is compared with the original number.

### Main Function

```cpp
int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter a Number: "; 
    cin >> n;                   
    Armstrong(n);              
    return 0;                  
}
```

- **Logic**: 
  - The `main` function prompts the user to enter a number.
  - It then calls the `Armstrong` function with the user-provided number to check if it is an Armstrong number.
  - The result is printed on the console.

## Summary

- The program checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number based on the defined conditions.
- The output indicates whether the number is an Armstrong number or not.
