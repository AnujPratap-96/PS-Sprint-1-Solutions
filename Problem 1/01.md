# Even or Odd Number Checker

This directory contains a C++ program that checks whether a given number is even or odd.

## Code Explanation

- **Header**: 
  The program includes the `bits/stdc++.h` header, which imports all standard C++ libraries. This simplifies the inclusion of necessary libraries.

- **Namespace**: 
  The `std` namespace is used to avoid writing `std::` before standard functions like `cout` and `cin`.

- **Main Function**: 
  - The program starts by declaring an integer variable `n`.
  - The user is prompted to enter a number using `cout`, and the number is read using `cin`.
  
- **Even-Odd Check**:
  - The program uses an `if-else` statement to check if the number is even or odd.
  - The condition `n % 2 == 0` checks if the remainder when `n` is divided by 2 is zero:
    - If true, the number is even, and the program outputs "Given Number is Even".
    - If false, the number is odd, and the program outputs "Given Number is Odd".

- **Program Termination**:
  - The `return 0;` statement indicates that the program has executed successfully.

## Key Code Snippet

```cpp
if (n % 2 == 0)
    cout << "Given Number is Even";
else
    cout << "Given Number is Odd";
```

This snippet checks whether the number is even or odd using the modulus operator (`%`).

## Usage

The program prompts the user for an integer input and then displays whether the number is even or odd.
