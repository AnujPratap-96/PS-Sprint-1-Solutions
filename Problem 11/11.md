# LCM Calculator

This directory contains a C++ program that calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers using two approaches: a Brute Force approach and an Optimal approach using the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) method.

## Code Explanation

### Brute Force Approach

```cpp
int findLCMBruteForce(int a, int b) {
    int maxNum = max(a, b);
    int lcm = maxNum;

    while (true) {
        if (lcm % a == 0 && lcm % b == 0) {
            return lcm;
        }
        lcm++;
    }
}
```

- **Logic**: 
  - The brute force approach starts by selecting the larger of the two numbers, `maxNum`.
  - The function iteratively checks if this number is divisible by both `a` and `b`.
  - If it is divisible, the current value is the LCM and is returned.
  - If not, the number is incremented and the process continues until the LCM is found.

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the LCM value (which can be large for bigger inputs).

### Optimal Approach Using GCD

```cpp
int findGCD(int a, int b) {
    while (b != 0) {
        int temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
    return a;
}

int findLCMOptimal(int a, int b) {
    return (a * b) / findGCD(a, b);
}
```

- **Logic**: 
  - This approach calculates the LCM using the relationship between LCM and GCD: 
    \[
    \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
    \]
  - First, the **GCD** is calculated using the Euclidean algorithm, which efficiently finds the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
  - The formula then uses the GCD to compute the LCM.

- **Euclidean Algorithm** (for GCD):
  - This algorithm works by repeatedly calculating the remainder of the division of the two numbers until one becomes 0.
  - The other number is the GCD.

- **Time Complexity**: O(log(min(a, b))) for GCD calculation, which makes the optimal LCM calculation much faster than the brute force approach.

### Main Function

```cpp
int main() {
    int a = 12, b = 18;
    
    cout << "LCM (Brute Force) of " << a << " and " << b << " is: " << findLCMBruteForce(a, b) << endl;
    
    cout << "LCM (Optimal) of " << a << " and " << b << " is: " << findLCMOptimal(a, b) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

- **Logic**:
  - The program sets two sample numbers `a = 12` and `b = 18`.
  - It calculates and prints the LCM using both the brute force and optimal approaches, allowing for a comparison of the results.
  - Both approaches are tested with the same values, and the output is displayed on the console.

## Summary

- This program calculates the LCM of two numbers using two different approaches:
  1. **Brute Force**: Increments from the maximum of the two numbers until a common multiple is found.
  2. **Optimal Approach (using GCD)**: Utilizes the relationship between LCM and GCD to find the LCM efficiently.
