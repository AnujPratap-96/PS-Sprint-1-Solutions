# Prime Number Checker

This directory contains a C++ program with two methods to check whether a given number is prime. The first method uses a brute force approach, and the second method employs an optimized approach that reduces the number of iterations by checking up to the square root of the number.

## Code Explanation

### Brute Force Method

```cpp
void BrutePrime(int n) {
    int count = 0; 
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if(n % i == 0) count++;
    }
    if(count == 2) cout << "Number is Prime";
    else cout << "Number is not Prime";
}
```

- **Logic**: This method checks every number from `1` to `n` to determine if it is a divisor of `n`. A prime number has exactly two divisors: `1` and the number itself. The variable `count` keeps track of how many divisors the number has. If the count equals 2, the number is prime; otherwise, it is not.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) since we are iterating through all numbers from `1` to `n`.

### Optimized Method (Square Root Approach)

```cpp
void BetterPrime(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
        if(n % i == 0) {
            count++;
            if(n / i != i) count++;
        }
    }
    if(count == 2) cout << "Number is Prime";
    else cout << "Number is not Prime";
}
```

- **Logic**: This method reduces the number of iterations by checking up to the square root of `n`. For each divisor `i` found between `1` and `sqrt(n)`, both `i` and `n/i` are counted as divisors. If `i == n/i`, it is counted only once to avoid duplication.
- **Time Complexity**: O(sqrt(n)) since the loop runs only up to the square root of `n`, making this approach significantly faster than the brute force method.

### Main Function

```cpp
int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter a Number: ";
    cin >> n;
    BrutePrime(n);
    return 0;
}
```

- **Logic**: The main function prompts the user to enter a number and then calls the `BrutePrime` function to check if the number is prime. The result is printed on the console.

## Summary

- **BrutePrime()**: A straightforward method to check primality by counting divisors from `1` to `n`.
- **BetterPrime()**: An optimized method that reduces the time complexity by checking divisors only up to the square root of the number.
- **Output**: Both methods print whether the number is prime or not based on their respective logic.

This code demonstrates two different approaches to the same problem, showing both a brute force solution and an optimized solution.
