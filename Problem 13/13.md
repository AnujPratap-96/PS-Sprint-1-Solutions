# String Reversal Program

This directory contains a C++ program that reverses a given string using two different approaches:

1. **Brute Force Approach**: Reverses the string by creating a new string.
2. **Optimal Approach**: Reverses the string in place using the two-pointer method.

## Code Explanation

### Brute Force Approach

```cpp
void ReverseBrute(string s) {
    string reversed = "";  // Declare a new string to store the reversed characters
    
    // Loop through the original string from the end to the beginning
    for(int i = s.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        reversed += s[i];  // Append each character to the new string
    }
    
    // Output the reversed string
    cout << "Reversed String (Brute Force) is: " << reversed << endl;
}
```

- **Logic**:
  - A new string `reversed` is created.
  - The program loops through the input string from the last character to the first and appends each character to the new string.
  - The resulting string is the reversed version of the input string.

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string, as it needs to iterate through the entire string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), since a new string is created to store the reversed string.

### Optimal Approach (Two-Pointer Method)

```cpp
void ReverseOptimal(string s) {
    int i = 0, j = s.size() - 1;  // Initialize two pointers: one at the start and one at the end of the string
    
    // Loop to swap characters from both ends of the string until the pointers meet in the middle
    while(i < j) {
        swap(s[i], s[j]);  // Swap the characters at positions i and j
        i++;  // Move the left pointer to the right
        j--;  // Move the right pointer to the left
    }
    
    // Output the reversed string
    cout << "Reversed String (Optimal) is: " << s << endl;
}
```

- **Logic**:
  - The function uses two pointers `i` and `j` which start at the beginning and end of the string respectively.
  - It swaps the characters at `i` and `j` and moves the pointers towards the center until they meet.
  - The string is reversed in place without using extra space.

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as it only uses constant space.

### Main Function

```cpp
int main() {
    string s;  // Declare a string to store user input
    
    // Prompt the user to enter a string
    cout << "Enter a String: ";
    cin >> s;  // Read input from the user
    
    // Output the original string
    cout << "Original String: " << s << endl;
    
    // Call the brute force reverse function
    ReverseBrute(s);
    
    // Call the optimal reverse function
    ReverseOptimal(s);
    
    return 0;  // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
}
```

- **Logic**:
  - The program prompts the user to input a string and stores it in `s`.
  - It first calls the `ReverseBrute` function to reverse the string using the brute force method and prints the result.
  - It then calls the `ReverseOptimal` function to reverse the string in place and prints the result.

## Summary

This program reverses a given string using two approaches:
1. **Brute Force Approach**: Constructs a new reversed string by iterating through the original string in reverse order.
2. **Optimal Approach (Two-Pointer)**: Reverses the string in place by swapping characters from both ends using two pointers.

Both methods achieve the same goal, but the optimal approach is more space-efficient as it uses constant extra space.
